# Flight Scheduler

This Flight Scheduler system was created as the final project of my OOP class. The Flight Scheduler is a very simple version of a flight management system an airline would use. The back-end runs on a Netbeans Derby database in SQL and the front end is done in Java. The FMS has tabs where the usdr can create dates and flights and then add passengers to said flight. The user may also remove the passengers, flights and dates. This Flight Scheduler is a fully functioning program that was the product of 3 weeks of hard-work.
